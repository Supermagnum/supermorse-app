# Supermorse Modified Mumble Server

This repository contains a modified version of the Mumble server (Murmur) specifically designed for the Supermorse application. The server includes special features for amateur radio simulation, including HF band channels and realistic propagation simulation.

## Features

### HF Band Channels
- Channels corresponding to amateur radio frequencies (160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 10m, 6m)
- Channel descriptions with frequency ranges
- Channel links to simulate propagation overlap between bands

### Advanced Propagation Simulation
- **Realistic HF Propagation Model**: Based on solar conditions, geomagnetic activity, and seasonal variations
- **Solar Flux Index (SFI)**: Simulates the effect of solar activity on HF propagation
- **K-index**: Simulates the effect of geomagnetic activity on HF propagation
- **Seasonal Variations**: Simulates the effect of seasons on HF propagation
- **Day/Night Path Calculation**: Simulates the effect of daylight on HF propagation
- **Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF)**: Calculates the highest frequency that will be reflected by the ionosphere
- **Lowest Usable Frequency (LUF)**: Calculates the lowest frequency that will penetrate the D-layer absorption
- **Signal Strength Calculation**: Based on distance, frequency, solar conditions, and day/night path
- **Audio Quality Simulation**: Applies fading and noise based on signal strength

## Building the Server

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.15 or higher
- Qt 5.12 or higher
- C++ compiler with C++14 support (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- SQLite development libraries

### Building on Linux/macOS

```bash
# cd supermorse-mumble

# Build the server
./build.sh
```

### Building on Windows

```batch
# cd supermorse-mumble

# Build the server
build.bat
```

## Configuration

The server is configured using the `mumble-server.ini` file in the `config` directory. This file includes settings for:

### Server Settings
- Server name and welcome message
- Maximum number of users
- Default channel
- Server port and host
- Database configuration

### HF Band Simulation Settings
The `[hf_propagation]` section contains settings for the HF band simulation:

```ini
[hf_propagation]
; Enable or disable HF band simulation
enabled=true

; Solar Flux Index (SFI) - Measures solar activity
; Range: 60-300, higher values mean better propagation on higher bands
solar_flux_index=120

; K-index - Measures geomagnetic activity
; Range: 0-9, lower values mean better propagation
k_index=3

; Auto-detect season based on current date
auto_season=true

; Manual season setting (only used if auto_season=false)
; 0=Winter, 1=Spring, 2=Summer, 3=Fall
season=0

; Update interval for propagation conditions in minutes
update_interval=15
```

### Channel Configuration
The server includes predefined channels for HF bands:

```ini
[channels]
; Root channel
0=Root

; HF Band channels
1=160m
2=80m
3=60m
4=40m
5=30m
6=20m
7=17m
8=15m
9=10m
10=6m
```

### Channel Links
Channel links are used to simulate propagation overlap between bands:

```ini
[channel_links]
; Link channels that might have propagation overlap
1=2
2=1,3
3=2,4
4=3,5
5=4,6
6=5,7
7=6,8
8=7,9
9=8,10
10=9
```

### Custom Metadata Fields
The server supports custom metadata fields for grid locators and preferred bands:

```ini
[metadata_fields]
; Maidenhead grid locator
maidenheadgrid=text

; Preferred HF band
preferredhfband=select:160,80,60,40,30,20,17,15,10,6
```

## Running the Server

After building, the server executable can be found in the `build/bin` directory. To run the server:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./build/bin/murmur -c config/mumble-server.ini

# Windows
build\bin\Release\murmur.exe -c config\mumble-server.ini
```

Command-line options:
- `-c, --config <file>`: Specify the configuration file to use
- `-d, --database <file>`: Specify the database file to use

## How the HF Band Simulation Works

### Propagation Model

The HF band simulation uses a realistic propagation model based on:

1. **Solar Flux Index (SFI)**: Measures solar activity, which affects the ionization of the F-layer. Higher SFI values improve propagation on higher frequencies.
   - 60-80: Poor conditions (lower bands only)
   - 80-110: Fair conditions (mid-range bands)
   - 110-150: Good conditions (higher bands during day)
   - 150-300: Excellent conditions (all bands, 10m open during day)

2. **K-index**: Measures geomagnetic activity, which can disrupt the ionosphere. Lower K-index values mean better propagation.
   - 0-2: Quiet conditions (excellent propagation)
   - 3-4: Unsettled conditions (good propagation)
   - 5-6: Minor storm (degraded propagation on polar paths)
   - 7-9: Major storm (severely degraded propagation)

3. **Seasonal Variations**: Different seasons affect propagation due to changes in ionization and day length.
   - Winter: Better nighttime propagation on lower bands
   - Summer: Better daytime propagation on higher bands
   - Spring/Fall: Balanced propagation conditions

4. **Day/Night Path**: The percentage of the path between two stations that is in daylight affects propagation.
   - Daytime: Higher bands (10m-20m) work better
   - Nighttime: Lower bands (40m-160m) work better
   - Gray line: Enhanced propagation during sunrise/sunset

5. **Distance**: The distance between stations affects which bands work best.
   - Short distances (<500 km): Higher bands during day, lower bands at night
   - Medium distances (500-2000 km): Mid-range bands (20m-40m)
   - Long distances (>2000 km): Lower bands at night, higher bands during day with good conditions

### Signal Strength Calculation

Signal strength is calculated based on:
- Distance between grid locators
- Frequency (band)
- Solar flux index
- K-index
- Day/night path percentage
- Seasonal factors

The calculated signal strength affects:
- Audio quality (fading and noise)
- Whether communication is possible between users
- Band recommendations

### Band Recommendations

The server provides band recommendations based on:
- Current propagation conditions
- Distance between stations
- Time of day
- Season

Users receive recommendations when they connect and when propagation conditions change.

## Integration with Supermorse

This modified Mumble server is designed to work with the Supermorse application. The Supermorse application can start and stop this server programmatically and uses it for voice communication and HF simulation.
