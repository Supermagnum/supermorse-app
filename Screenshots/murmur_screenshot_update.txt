# Murmur Screenshot Update

## Updates Made to the Murmur GUI Interface

The Murmur GUI interface has been updated to show the available server rooms/channels in a dropdown selector. This enhancement improves the user experience by providing clear visibility of all available channels on the Murmur server.

### What's New in the Updated Screenshot:

1. **Channel Selector Dropdown**
   - Location: Below the "Available Rooms & Stations" heading
   - Shows multiple channel options:
     - General (Default)
     - HF Band channels (160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m, 6m)
     - Special channels (DX Cluster, Emergency Net, Digital Modes, Contest)

2. **Current Band Display**
   - Shows which band/channel is currently selected
   - Updates when a user selects a different channel from the dropdown

3. **Channel Switching Functionality**
   - When a user selects a different channel, the system:
     - Updates the current band display
     - Adjusts the propagation indicator based on the selected band
     - Refreshes the list of stations visible on that band
     - Shows a system message confirming the channel switch

These updates ensure that users can see and interact with all available channels configured on the Murmur server, as defined in the Server.cpp setup.

### Implementation Details:

- The channel list is dynamically populated from the server configuration
- Each HF band has its own channel, reflecting different frequency ranges
- Special purpose channels are also available for specific types of communication
- The UI adapts to show currently active users in the selected channel
- Proper visual feedback is provided when switching between channels

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by making the channel structure of the server more transparent and accessible to users.
