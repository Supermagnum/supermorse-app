## ðŸ”¢ RST Signal Reporting System

The **RST** system is used to report signal readability, strength, and tone (for CW). Example: `599`.

| Component | Range | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **R** (Readability) | 1â€“5 | 1 = unreadable, 5 = perfectly readable |
| **S** (Signal Strength) | 1â€“9 | 1 = very weak, 9 = extremely strong |
| **T** (Tone) â€“ CW only | 1â€“9 | 1 = very rough tone, 9 = pure tone |

ðŸ“Œ Example:
- **599** = Perfect readability, strong signal, pure tone (CW).
- **59** = Used in voice modes (no tone needed).
